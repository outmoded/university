## Community Development

Originally, hapijs/university started as a distributed learning experiment to teach people coding skills as a group.  
Excitingly, as a group, the university developed a solid hapijs application. Thus, the project also became sample code 
showing people new to hapi how to build a hapijs application. 

As the university moves forward, we will still code as a group.
To do this, we will periodically:

* Issue an assignment<br/>
  See [Issues List Here](https://github.com/hapijs/university/issues), in this list look 
  for the issue labelled "assignment". That issue will describe the requirements of the current assignment.
  At anytime the issue list may contain: a newly issued assignment, discussion about the next assignment, or list maintenance work to be done.
* Anyone is welcome to fork the project, write code fulfilling the assignment requirements and submit a PR.
* After PRs are submitted, we peer review each others PRs and learn from the critiques.<br/>
  Look at what others are submitting and see if you can improve your own solution (borrow ideas, add tests, write examples, update the documentation). 
  If you see ways in which others can improve their solution, comment on their Pull Request.
* At the end of an assignment and peer review process, we have a nice refined solution that may be merged into the project.
* Merge in a PR and move on to the next assignment.
* Before starting the next assignment, make sure [your fork matches the current master](guides/git.md) since only one Pull Request can be accepted.
